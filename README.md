# Nand2Tetris-VM Translator

This program translates VM code to assembly instructions for the Hack computer architecture. This project was completed as part of the Nand2Tetris course. This is a free online project based course where the student starts with a fundamental element, the Nand gate, and uses the Nand gate to build a computer architecture. Once the computer itself is built the student then goes on to design an assembler, VM translator, compiler, and operating system for the machine. The VM translator is completed in Chapters 8 and 9 of the course.
